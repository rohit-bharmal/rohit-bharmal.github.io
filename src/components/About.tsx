              I'm Rohit Bharmal, an Associate Software Engineer at Red Hat with
              a strong focus on frontend development and user experience. At Red
              Hat, I've contributed to key projects on the Customer Portal,
              including the Security Advisory and CVE Database. Using
              technologies like Vue.js and JavaScript, I've built dynamic,
              responsive interfaces that help thousands of users navigate
              complex security information with ease.

              My work involves more than just coding â€” I collaborate closely
              with designers, product managers, and backend engineers to create
              seamless, cross-browser-compatible solutions that prioritize
              performance and accessibility. I'm passionate about building
              products that not only look good but also solve real-world
              problems efficiently.

              Whether it's optimizing UI workflows or implementing robust
              frontend architectures, I strive to deliver clean, maintainable
              code and a smooth user experience. I've also been recognized with
              the Red Hat eXcEed Award for my impact and contributions.
